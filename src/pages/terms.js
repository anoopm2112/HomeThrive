              <strong>Entire Agreement.</strong> These Terms of Use and the
              Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between Miracle
              Foundation and you concerning your access and use of the Website,
              and these Terms of Use supersede and replace any prior agreements
              between Miracle Foundation and you regarding use of the Website.
              The Terms of Use may not be modified orally. These Terms of Use
              may not be modified or superseded by Miracle Foundation’
              acceptance of any offer from you or any other person
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Severability.</strong> If for any reason a court of
              competent jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms of Use
              or portion thereof to be unenforceable, that provision shall be
              enforced to the maximum extent permissible so as to effect the
              intent of these Terms of Use, and the remainder of these Terms of
              Use shall continue in full force and effect. No waiver by Miracle
              Foundation of any breach or default hereunder shall be deemed to
              be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
              Miracle Foundation may revise these Terms of Use from time to
              time; the most current version will always be at
              www.fostershare.org/terms. By continuing to access or use the
              Website after those revisions become effective, you agree to be
              bound by the revised terms.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Waiver.</strong> If we waive enforcement of any provision
              in these Terms of Use, we are not obligated to continue to waive
              it.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Third-Party Beneficiaries.</strong>Other than the
              Miracle Foundation, no other person or company will be third-party
              beneficiaries to the Terms of Use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Governing Law.</strong> This Agreement shall in all
              respects be interpreted, enforced and governed under the laws of
              the State of Texas, without regard to any rules of conflict of
              laws that would require the application of the laws of a state
              other than Texas.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arbitration.</strong> If there is any dispute, claim,
              question or disagreement concerning or relating to these Terms of
              Use or the Website (a “Dispute”), you shall notify Miracle
              Foundation in writing to attempt to resolve such Dispute in good
              faith negotiations. For a period of 30 days following such
              notification, you and Miracle Foundation shall use their best
              efforts to settle any such Dispute in these good faith
              negotiations, which shall be a condition precedent to either party
              initiating arbitration. You agree that any Dispute must be filed
              within one year after such Dispute first arises or it is forever
              barred. All Disputes, regardless of the grounds upon which such
              Dispute is brought, shall be settled by binding arbitration
              conducted by a single, independent arbitrator and administered by
              the American Arbitration Association Commercial Arbitration Rules
              and procedures then in effect, but excluding any rules or
              procedures governing or permitting class actions. By agreeing to
              arbitrate all Disputes, each party waives all rights to a trial by
              jury in any action or proceeding involving any Disputes. The
              arbitration shall take place in Travis County, Texas. You agree to
              submit to the personal jurisdiction of any federal or state court
              in Travis County, Texas, in order to compel arbitration, to stay
              proceedings pending arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or
              enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator, and you
              waive any argument that such forum does not have personal
              jurisdiction, is not appropriate or is inconvenient. You further
              agree that all Disputes and causes of action arising out of or in
              connection with the Website shall be resolved individually without
              resort to any form of class action and shall not be consolidated
              or joined with or in any arbitration or other proceeding involving
              a Dispute of any other party – the arbitrator shall have no
              authority to arbitrate any Dispute as a class action or in any
              other form other than on an individual basis. Judgment on the
              award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered by any court
              having jurisdiction thereof.

              <strong>Construction.</strong>The headings used in these Terms of
              Use are for convenience only and have no legal meaning or effect.
              Terms defined in the singular have the corresponding meanings in
              the plural, and vice versa. Unless the context of these Terms of
              Use clearly requires otherwise, words importing the masculine
              gender include the feminine and neutral genders and vice versa.
              The terms “include,” “includes” or “including” mean “including
              without limitation.” The words “hereof,” “hereto,” “hereby,”
              “herein,” “hereunder” and words of similar import, when used in
              these Terms of Use, refer to these Terms of Use as a whole and not
              to any particular section or article in which such words appear.
              The word “or” will not be construed as exclusive.
